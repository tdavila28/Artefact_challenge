    The satellite image classifier is inspired by the open access EuroSat dataset.
    <br>
    Composed with in total 27,000 labeled and geo-referenced images.
    <br>
    This challenge aims to classify 10 different classes of LuLc screening in the Sentinel -2 satellite images in RGB frequency bands encoding, applying a customized and pretrained RESNET50 model (code link below).
    <br>
    LuLc classes: {0: 'AnnualCrop', 1: 'Forest', 2: 'HerbaceousVegetation', 3: 'Highway',
    4: 'Industrial', 5: 'Pasture', 6: 'PermanentCrop', 7: 'Residential', 8: 'River', 9: 'SeaLake'}.
    <br>
    The metric used for performance evaluation was Recall, and the library to design the architecture of the model was Tensorflow and Keras.
